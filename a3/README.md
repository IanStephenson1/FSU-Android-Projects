# LIS4331 - Advanced Mobile Applications Development

## Ian Stephenson

### Assignment 3 Requirements:

*Research how to complete the following requirements(see screenshots below):*

1. Field to enter U.S. dollar amount: 1 – 100,000
2. Must include toast notification if user enters out-of-range values
3. Radio buttons to convert from U.S. to Euros, Pesos and Canadian currency (must be vertically and horizontally aligned)
4. Must include correct sign for euros, pesos, and Canadian dollars
5. Must add background color(s) or theme
6. Create and display launcher icon image
7. Create Splash/Loading Screen:
    + a. Purpose: *not* to waste a user’s time, but rather give them something informative and
    visually appealing while they wait for an app to load. Examples of judicial/appropriate usage
    would be when an app is resource intensive--that is, when pulling in data, making network
    calls, or other time-consuming events.
    + b. How: Research why--and how to create--Android splash/loading screens. Moreover, instead
    of just using a static image, employ some type of *animated* splash screen or other device
    that either is informative or promotes you, your company, and will maintain the user's
    attention--note: no more than 3 seconds.
